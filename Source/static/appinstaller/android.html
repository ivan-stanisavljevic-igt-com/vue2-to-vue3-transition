<div class="heading">How to download and install the IGT Sportsbook Android App.</div>
<p>On an Android phone, IGT Sportsbook recommends using the Samsung Internet Browser (should be installed by default for Samsung users) and Firefox web browser (for LG and Google users which should be installed on your device from the Play Store).</p>
<p class="desc">*Please note that some Android phones purchased through your phone provider do not come with the native Android browser installed.  We recommend installing the Firefox browser, and then downloading the IGT Sportsbook app.</p>
<div class="heading">Why we are not in the Google Play Store</div>
<p>Unfortunately, Google doesn't allow any wagering apps in the Play Store yet.  This means you need to download our Android app directly from us.  Don't worry!  Our Android app is secure and is built to IGT Sportsbook and Google's same high standards.</p>

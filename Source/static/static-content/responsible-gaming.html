<h1>Our Commitment to our Betly Patrons:</h1>
<h3>Responsible Gaming and Patron Protection</h3>
<p>We want you to play safely and responsibly. Only bet what you can afford and always set reasonable limits for yourself.  If you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). You can also contact the <a href="https://www.1800gambler.net/" >Problem Gamblers Help Network</a> or the <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/">National Council on Problem Gambling</a>.</p>
<h3>Know Your Limits</h3>
<p>At the Betly Sportsbook, we want our patrons to enjoy playing their favorite games and gamble responsibly. Always establish time limits and limits for depositing and spending before you start playing. Never gamble if it interferes with your daily responsibilities, if you are under the influence of alcohol or any other substance or your primary aim is to recover losses. To set your play, deposit, wager and loss limits from within the Betly app, go to Settings > Responsible Gaming > Gaming Limits, to set your weekly limits.</p>
<h3>Self-Exclusion</h3>
<p>You have the right to place yourself on the Self-Exclusion list for Betly at Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack, which will preclude you from engaging in gaming with us. Self-Exclusion is instant, and for the time period selected you will be able to access your account and make withdrawals, but will no longer be able to wager for the time period chosen. You can Self-Exclude directly from the app under the responsible gaming section, or simply contact us.</p>

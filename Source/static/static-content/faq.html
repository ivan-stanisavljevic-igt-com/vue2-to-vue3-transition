If you are not in West Virginia and try to place a bet, you will receive a message stating that your bet could not be placed.</p>

<h3>8. What can I bet on?</h3>

<p>Depending on what sports are available currently, you can bet on just about any sport across the globe. When in season, you can legally bet on things like; pro football, pro basketball, pro baseball, college football, college basketball, golf, auto racing, tennis, MMA, and boxing.</p>

<h3>What types of bets are available?</h3>

<span><b>Money Line</b> - The odds of a team winning the game outright</span>  
<p>Ex: Yankees -240 (bet $240 to win $100) vs Red Sox +300 (bet $100 to win $300)</p>
<p><b>Point Spreads</b> - The odds of a team winning or losing by a certain margin</p> 
<p>Ex: Steelers -7.5 (favorite- must win by 8 or more points) vs Browns +7.5 (underdog- must lose by 7 or fewer points or win)</p>
<p><b>Total (Over/Under)</b> - The total number of points scored by both teams is set by the oddsmakers. You can bet that the actual total amount of points scored will be over or under that amount.</p>
<p><b>Straight bet</b> - When you bet on the spread, money line, or total of single game, you're making what is referred to as a 'straight bet'.</p>
<p><b>Parlay</b> - When you bet on two or more point spreads, totals or money lines. Combining bets into a parlay means a bigger payout - but you must win them all. If one of your selections loses, the entire wager is lost. </p>
<p><b>Round Robin</b> - Like the Lions, Tigers, and Bears? A round robin allows you to bet on all parlay combinations of those three teams with a single click (Lions & Tigers, Lions & Bears, Tigers & Bears, Lions & Tigers & Bears).</p>
<p><b>Futures Bets</b> - This means the outcome of your bet will be determined at a future date. Think this is the year the Browns make the playoffs? Believe LeBron takes the Lakers to the NBA Finals? Have the excitement of an entire season by making a future bet.</p>
<p><b>Prop Bets</b> - Prop bets allow you to bet on single events during a specific game. Ex. Who is going to score the first touchdown of the game? Will Joel Embiid score over/under 39.5 points tonight? Which team will hit a homerun first?</p>
